Welcome to Team Tech! Here is how you can get started:
* Tell us your email and we can invite you as a collaborator to our TeamTech21_MERN repositiory
* Get started by installing the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension on Visual Studio Code
* Go to source control page and click clone repository (you will be prompted to sign in to your Github)
* Select TeamTech21_MERN to clone
* It will require that you create a local directory on your computer to host the repository
* Once you select this local directory, open it
* Run the command "cd frontend" and run "npm i" in terminal
* Still in the frontend folder, run "npm start" to see if your front end directories are working properly
* Now run "cd.." and then "cd backend"
* In the backend folder, run "node server.js" to check if your backend is running properly
